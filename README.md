# SecureScan â€” Cyber Threat Analysis (Frontend + FastAPI backend)

SecureScan is a browser-based vulnerability scanner UI paired with a FastAPI backend for server-side scanning. The frontend performs client-side heuristics (regex + JavaScript AST via Esprima) and the backend accepts uploaded source files and returns structured findings that the UI renders.
